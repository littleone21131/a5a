jQuery:
Purpose: jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that makes it easier to handle HTML document traversal, event handling, animation, and Ajax interactions.
Target Audience: It's a general-purpose library meant for web development, regardless of device type or screen size.
Features: jQuery provides methods for DOM manipulation, event handling, animations, Ajax requests, and cross-browser compatibility. It's used to simplify and standardize JavaScript code across different web browsers.
Responsive Design: While jQuery itself doesn’t have any direct features related to responsive design, developers can use jQuery alongside CSS media queries and other frameworks like Bootstrap to create responsive web pages.

Key Differences:
Focus:

jQuery is a general-purpose library for manipulating the DOM, handling events, and working with Ajax in web applications.
jQuery Mobile is a framework designed specifically for building mobile web apps with a mobile-friendly UI.

UI Components:

jQuery itself doesn’t provide mobile-specific UI elements.
jQuery Mobile comes with a wide array of mobile-optimized UI elements like buttons, toolbars, collapsible lists, and grids designed for touch devices.

Responsive and Mobile-Optimized:

jQuery isn’t inherently focused on responsive design; developers need to use CSS frameworks or write custom styles.
jQuery Mobile is mobile-first and automatically adjusts the layout for different screen sizes and orientations.

Performance:

jQuery is a lightweight, general-purpose library, but it’s not tailored for mobile performance.
jQuery Mobile, while offering convenience, can be heavier than jQuery alone due to its additional mobile-specific UI components, which can impact performance on older or slower devices.
